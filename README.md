# Welcome to Pizza Brain!

Hello :)

Pizza Brain is a simple app to simulate ordering pizza with many flavors and sizes. 

I used some hooks that React gives for use, for example: **useMemo, useState, useContext and useEffect**, and used **Typescript.**

### Most important Libs

 1. react-testing-library
 2. react-hook-form
 3. styled-components
 4. yup

### Future steps

 1. Create more unit tests cases (some importants);
 2. Create a backend to simply build request for the webapp;
 3. Persist data on localStorage;
 4. Use Redux (just for fun), to feel in a better way the difference between Redux and Context in the same project.

### How to run application

**You must have NodeJs installed on your system.**

1.  `git clone`  or  **download**  the repository
2.  Go to folder and run on terminal  `npm install`  to install all libs that are necessary for the application to run.
3.  Run  `npm start`  to start the application
4.  Go to localhost:3000
5. 
### How to test application

1.  Go to folder and run on terminal  `npm install`  to install all libs that are necessary for the application to run.
2.  Run  `npm run test`  to test the application
